## 💪 Personal projects

I am spending some time on the following projects:

- [IoT automobile](https://github.com/batuan/project_iot_automobile): My first data pipeline for IoT connected device. In this project, I monitor data from automobile, and save the data to Big database. I have 2 solutions: GCP and Open-Source. You can check my source code (almost bash script and terraform)
- [MLOps zoomcampt](https://github.com/batuan/mlops-zoomcamp): An bootcamp from [Datatalk club](https://datatalks.club/), in this boot camp I will learn how to deploy an end-to-end Machine Learning model. I will update homework and project regularly.
- [TIAD](https://github.com/batuan/TER_TIAD_2021): an NLP contest that I participated in 2021.
